Sudoku solver
=============

This is a simple sudoku solver, which (until now) uses a backtracking
algorithm.

Compilation
-----------

To compile the program run the command `make'

   $ make

Execution
---------

The sudokus are stored in .txt files in the sudokus/ directory.  To
solve one run

   $ ./sudoku_solver -f sudokus/s1.txt

Sudoku text files
-----------------

The sudoku solver input files are simple text files, where the sudoku
is stored in a table format where the columns are separated by
whitespace.  Newlines and lines that begin with `#' are ignored.  See
sudokus/s1.txt for an example.

Help
----
